         * So we have our products, but what are we going to do with them.
         *
         * Let's create a cart that people can add products to. The cart should also be Describable.
         * Create a class called ShoppingCart that contains the following public methods.
         *
         * 1. provideDescription() - We are implmenting the Describably method after all.
         *     Come up with a good way to describe what is in your cart in this method.
         * 2. addProduct($product) - Add a product to the cart.
         *     Throw an exception if what we are adding to the cart is not of type Product
         * 3. removeOne($product) - Remove a single item that matches your product parameter.
         *     Throw an exception if your cart does not have any instances of that product in your cart
         * 4. removeAll($product) - Remove all instances of the product passed in.
         *     Throw an exception if your cart does not have any instances of that product in your cart.
         * 5. getTotalPrice() - Get the total price of all the contents in your cart.
         * 6. getAllProducts() - Get an array of all products that exist in your shopping cart.
         * 7. findProductByName($name) - Find the first instance of a product by the name passed in
         *     Throw an exception if a product is not found with that name.
         *
         * HINTS - You will be able to reuse some code in this challenge.  Think about it, removing all involves
         * removing one many times.  In your provideDescription method on your cart, you could (wink, wink) provide
         * each of your products to describe themselves.  It may also be useful to print how many items are in the cart or how much
         * the price of your total cart is.
         *
         * Perform the following tasks:
         *
         * 1. Create at least one Clothing Object and one Television Object.
         * 2. Create a shopping cart instance.
         * 3. Add the two products to the cart.
         * 4. Print out the description of the cart.
         * 5. Print out the total price of the cart.
         * 6. Remove the Clothing object from your cart.
         * 7. FInd the product in the cart with the name of your Television Object.
         * 8. Pass your ShoppingCart into the ItemDescriber outputDescription method from Exercise 4 and see
         * how it will also output the description of your cart, just like it did your individual products
