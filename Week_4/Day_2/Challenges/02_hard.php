         * OVERVIEW:
         * We've decided we want to add "wishlist" functionality to our site.  If you think about it,
         * a Wishlist is just a container that holds items just like a ShoppingCart. One major difference,
         * however, is that you can only add a product to a wishlist once.  Make sure that you account for this
         * functionality in your wishlist by using exceptions.  Remember that you can override behavior in inheritance and
         * how abstract classes work.  We are going to change the structure of your ShoppingCart Class from
         * the first Challenge so that we can re-use the code in a Wishlist.
         *
         * INSTRUCTIONS:
         * 1. Create an abstract class called ProductContainer.  This class should contain all of the behavior that
         * was included in your shopping cart from Challenge 1 that will be shared between your WishList and ShoppingCart.
         * Any behavior that should be different between the WishList and ShoppingCart should be written as an abstract
         * method.
         * 2. Create a ShoppingCart class that extends the Product Container class.  Implement the abstract methods that you
         * specified in step1 in your ShoppingCart method.
         * 3. Create a WishList class that extends the Product Container class.  Implement the abstract methods that you
         * specified in step1 in your WishList method.
         * 4. Override the provideDescription method in each child class to add "Container Type: " and whether it is a
         * ShoppingCart or WishList.  Remember how to reference the parent class to utilize its behavior.
         * 5. Create a static method on the ProductContainer class called createCartFromContainer($productContainer).  This
         * Method should take in any ProductContainer as a parameter.  It should then copy the contents of the container
         * that is passed in to a new instance of a ShoppingCart and return the ShoppingCart.  If the parameter $productContainer
         * that is passed into the static method is not a ProductContainer, throw an exception.
         * 6. Create at least one Clothing object and one Television Object from Exercise 2.
         * 7. Create a Wishlist Object
         * 8. Add each of the Products to your Wishlist.
         * 9. Now create a ShoppingCart that Mirrors your wishlist by calling the createCartFromContainer method.
         * 10. Print out the description (provideDescription) of both your wishlist and your shopping cart to make sure that
         * they have the same products in them.
