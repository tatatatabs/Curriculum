         * OVERVIEW:
         * Let's attempt to build a clone of Amazon.com
         *
         * First thing we need are some products to sell.  In order to sell them though,
         * we need to be able to provide a description to our customers.  Sounds easy, but we
         * want different products to provide different types of descriptions based on their
         * category.  We do not want to have to use an if statement to do this either.
         *
         * INSTRUCTIONS:
         * Create an interface called Describable that contains one method: provideDescription
         *
         * Create a class called Product that contains protected properties "name", "price",
         * "brand", and "description". Create a constructor for Product that takes all of these as
         * parameters and initialize the property values. Product should also implement the
         * Describable interface. Have the method that you need to implement from the Describable
         * interface return the description of the product.
         *
         * Now, create a few products and echo out their description.
         *
         * Name: "Hawaiian shirt"
         * Brand: "Hang 10"
         * Price: "23.99"
         * Description: "Shirt With Flowers And Red in Color.  Size is Large.  Men Only."
         *
         * Name: "4K Television"
         * Brand: "TVs Unlimited"
         * Price: "$100.00"
         * Description: "Small Televison (19 inches).  Has resolution of 4k"
         *
         * Name: "3D TV"
         * Brand: "LV"
         * Price "100 dollars and 99 cents"
         * Description: "Does not come with glasses"
         *
         * Name: "Hawaiian Skirt"
         * Brand: "Hang 10"
         * Price: "25"
         * Description: "Womens Skirt...Size 6"
         *
