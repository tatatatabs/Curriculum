     * Let's protect our class' properties so no one can change the name or health directly.
     *
     * Copy your class from the previous exercise, then change the properties to be protected.
     *
     * Once the properties are protected you will need to add GETTER methods so we can still
     * access the values. So, add two methods called "getName" and "getHealth" that return the
     * value of the name and health properties respectively.
     *
     * Finally, now that your name and health properties are protected, fix the line that
     * prints out each monster's name and health.
