	<!-- 3. format the lyrics below into paragraphs  -->

		Just a small town girl
		Livin' in a lonely world
		She took the midnight train
		Goin' anywhere
		Just a city boy
		Born and raised in South Detroit
		He took the midnight train
		Goin' anywhere

		A singer in a smokey room
		The smell of wine and cheap perfume
		For a smile they can share the night
		It goes on and on and on and on

		Strangers waiting
		Up and down the boulevard
		Their shadows searching
		In the night
		Streetlight people
		Livin' just to find emotion
		Hidin' somewhere in the night
